"To Explore and Quantify the Human Effect on Earth"
</div>

It is the ultimate goal of 39Alpha teams to perform original research which explores and quantifies
humanities various interactions with our bio-geochemical environment. Specifically, we are focused
on interactions which may not reside in steady state, so that we might identify deleterious
components of our effects, and postulate associated solutions.

The 39Alpha teams are free to engage in research which supports this ultimate goal in any way they
see fit. The developing projects diagrammed below are examples of the type of projects to which
teams will apply themselves.
