# 39 Alpha Teams

**At 39 Alpha Research, all of our researchers work and publish as part of a team. We have no
individual authors.**

Science is rarely done by individuals. Most researchers in a university or industry setting work as
a team, but authorship becomes a point of contention when it comes time to publish. The order of
authors on a publication traditionally indicates how much each person contributed or their status
in the group. How do you evaluate one person's contribution to a body of work in the dynamic and
creative environment of a lab?

At 39 Alpha Research, all of our researchers work and publish as part of a team. While one member
may contribute a technical skill, another might provide insight or conceptual clarity. We believe
both contributions are indispensible. In this spirit, teams publish their work under their team
name. There are no individual authors.
