# Who we are
39Alpha is a nonprofit independent scientific research organization envisioned and founded by
doctors of physics, information science, and geochemistry.

# What we are doing
We are conducting original open-source research on topics which further our scientific mission: [To
explore and quantify human interactions with the Earth]({{< relref "science-mission.md" >}}). We
carry out this research under the direction of guiding principles which represent paradigm shifts in
_how_ open source research is conducted. This 39Alpha method stands apart from modern scientific
orthodoxy in [three differentiating ways]({{< relref "five-differentiators.md" >}}):

1. **We operate and publish as a [team]({{< relref "t0.md" >}}).** There are no individual authors!
2. **We publish our tools (software) in full**, integrated within and alongside our scientific
   publications.
3. **We make our failures public.** Tools, methodology, everything other researchers might need to learn from our expeirence, correct our mistakes, and avoid out pitfalls.

# Why we are doing it
We believe that there is inherent value in quantifying our biological, chemical, and integrated
place on Earth, and we believe that modern scientific practices can be evolved to be more creative,
more efficient, and more consequential.
