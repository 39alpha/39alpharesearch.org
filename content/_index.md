<span class="shout shout--inline">39 Alpha is a nonprofit, scientific research organization</span> envisioned and founded by doctors of physics, information science, and geochemistry.

We are conducting original open-source research on topics which further our scientific mission: **To
explore and quantify human interactions with the Earth**. We carry out this research under the
direction of guiding principles which represent paradigm shifts in _how_ research is conducted. This
39 Alpha method stands apart from modern scientific orthodoxy in **three differentiating ways**:

1. **We operate and publish as a [team](team).** There are no individual authors.
2. **We publish our tools (software) in full**, integrated within and alongside our scientific
   publications.
3. **We make our failures public.** Tools, methodology, everything other researchers might need to
   learn from our experience, correct our mistakes, and avoid out pitfalls.
