We are conducting original open-source research on topics which further our scientific mission: [To
explore and quantify human interactions with the Earth]({{< relref "science-mission.md" >}}). We
carry out this research under the direction of guiding principles which represent paradigm shifts in
_how_ research is conducted. This 39Alpha method stands apart from modern scientific

1. **We operate and publish as a [team]({{< relref "t0.md" >}}).** There are no individual authors!
2. **We publish our tools (software) in full**, integrated within and alongside our scientific
   publications.
3. **We make our failures public.** Tools, methodology, everything other researchers might need to learn from our expeirence, correct our mistakes, and avoid out pitfalls.
