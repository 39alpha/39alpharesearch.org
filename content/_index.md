1. **We operate and publish as teams.** There are no individual authors.
2. **Our researchers do not hustle their own research grants.** Their job is to do research.
3. **We publish our tools (software) in full**, integrated within and alongside our scientific
   publications.
4. **We publish our failures as such.**
5. **Our teams engage on one project at a time**, devoting their full attention to solving
   large-scale highly innovative and unconventional problems.
   to evolving the method by which our teams interact, operate, and measure achievement.
