    39Alpha is a nonprofit, scientific research organization.
</div>

We are conducting original open-source research on topics which further our scientific mission:
<span class="emphasize">To explore and quantify human interactions with the Earth</span>. We carry
out this research under the direction of guiding principles which represent paradigm shifts in _how_
research is conducted. This 39Alpha method stands apart from modern scientific orthodoxy in <span

1. **We operate and publish as a <span class="emphasize">team</span>.** There are no individual authors!
2. **We publish our tools (software) in full**, integrated within and alongside our scientific
   publications.
3. **We make our failures public.** Tools, methodology, everything other researchers might need to learn from our expeirence, correct our mistakes, and avoid out pitfalls.

# Who we are
39Alpha is a nonprofit independent scientific research organization envisioned and founded by
doctors of physics, information science, and geochemistry.

# What we are doing
We are conducting original open-source research on topics which further our scientific mission. We
carry out this research under the direction of guiding principles which represent paradigm shifts in
_how_ open source research is conducted. This 39Alpha method stands apart from modern scientific
orthodoxy in three differentiating ways:

<style>
ol li {
    padding-bottom: 1em;
    margin-left: 2em;
}
</style>

1. **We operate and publish as a team.** There are no individual authors!
2. **We publish our tools (software) in full**, integrated within and alongside our scientific
   publications.
3. **We make our failures public.** Tools, methodology, everything other researchers might need to learn from our expeirence, correct our mistakes, and avoid out pitfalls.

# Why we are doing it
We believe that there is inherent value in quantifying our biological, chemical, and integrated
place on Earth, and we believe that modern scientific practices can be evolved to be more creative,
more efficient, and more consequential.

# Team Driven
Research at 39Alpha is conducted by teams of five (four Ph.D's and one part-time freshman
undergraduate student), and is published as such. There are no individual authors. The reputation of
the team (and its members) are one. We believe that the modern publication paradigm centered on
individual authorship actively incentivizes behavior that, while necessarily beneficial to
individual careers, hampers scientific progress. Modern researchers compete with one another in ways
that dissuade unfettered collaboration, information sharing, trust, and efficient divisions of
labor. By shifting the publication unit away form individuals and onto small teams, 39Alpha will
foster intra-team environments which incentivize these integral concepts.

# Open Source Tools
39Alpha teams will publish their tools open-source, together with their results. Much of modern
research science relies on large quantities of data generated, processed, handled, and interpreted
by custom software built by researchers. While it is standard practice for the eventual research
publications to go through a review process, it is far from standard to release the source code of
the software which generated the results to either the reviewers nor the scientific community at
large. This makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to confirm or reproduce the results of
others. Reproducibility is central and essential to the establishment of scientific discovery within
the larger scientific discourse. Beyond publishing in open-source peer reviewed journals, the teams
at 39Alpha will produce interactive versions of their publications on the 39Alpha site. These
versions will be interactive insofar as all figures and calculations will link to the original code
which generated them. In this way, all tools will be published alongside results, allowing others to
test the exact code used in a given study, potentially improve upon its form and function, and
employ and evolve the results themselves. This shift in practices is fundamental to the future
health of nearly all science steeped in analytical techniques, large data sets, and complex systems
analysis.

# Publish Failure
39Alpha teams will digitally publish approaches and efforts that failed to solve a given problem.
Modern science does not overtly publish failing efforts, as individual reputations and careers are
done no favors by doing so. Approaches which do not work are instead passed down culturally through
the experience of individual researchers who collaborate with one another. However these lessons and
the insights gained from failure are not published to the wider community. This sets the stage for
an odd reality. A researcher failing to find evidence of a novel idea within the literature has
either wandered into a brilliant realization, untested and unexplored, or has stumbled upon an
inevitable failure, encountered many times before by many others, to which there is no warning! As
modern publishing practices do not publish failures, researchers are doomed to repeat the same
mistakes as those who came before them, wasting time, effort, and resources. At 39Alpha, team
projects which are unsuccessful in either confirming or rejecting their original hypothesis due to
shortcomings in method, initial assumptions, false pretenses, etc., will nonetheless publish these
failures in the same digital interactive style as their successes. Though not published in
peer-reviewed journals like their successful counterparts, they will nonetheless be identified as
failures and made available to the larger scientific community, code and all.

"To Explore and Quantify the Human Effect on Earth"
</div>

It is the ultimate goal of 39Alpha teams to perform original research which explores and quantifies
humanities various interactions with our bio-geochemical environment. Specifically, we are focused
on interactions which may not reside in steady state, so that we might identify deleterious
components of our effects, and postulate associated solutions.

The 39Alpha teams are free to engage in research which supports this ultimate goal in any way they
see fit. The developing projects diagrammed below are examples of the type of projects to which
teams will apply themselves.
