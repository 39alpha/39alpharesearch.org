# Who we are
39Alpha is a nonprofit independent scientific research organization envisioned and founded by
doctors of physics, information science, and geochemistry.

# What we are doing
We are conducting original open-source research on topics which further our scientific mission: [To
explore and quantify human interactions with the Earth]({{< relref "science-mission.md" >}}). We
carry out this research under the direction of guiding principles which represent paradigm shifts in
_how_ open source research is conducted. This 39Alpha method stands apart from modern scientific
orthodoxy in [six differentiating ways]({{< relref "six-differentiators.md" >}}):

1. **We operate and publish as teams.** There are no individual authors.
2. **Our researchers do not hustle their own research grants.** Their job is to do research.
3. **We publish our tools (software) in full**, integrated within and alongside our scientific
   publications.
4. **We publish our failures as such.**
5. **Our teams engage on one project at a time**, devoting their full attention to solving
   large-scale highly innovative and unconventional problems.
6. **39Alpha maintains an in-house [social-psychology]({{< relref social-psych.md >}}) team** dedicated
   to evolving the method by which our teams interact, operate, and measure achievement.

# Why we are doing it
We believe that there is inherent value in quantifying our biological, chemical, and integrated
place on Earth, and we believe that modern scientific practices can be evolved to be more creative,
more efficient, and more consequential.
