At 39 Alpha, we are more than just a team of geochemists, physicists, and software developers. We are passionate problem solvers, dedicated to making a meaningful impact on the world by conducting oiriginal scientific research that has a posative inpact on the enviornment, and by extension, humanity. Thats why 39Alpha's [Team 0](/team) is developing novel research methods to aid in the discovery of mineral-based low-cost hydrogen generation techniqes.

When water interacts with naturally occuring rocks and mienrals in the environemnt, dihydrogen (H2) can be
generated. But only sometimes, and only under certian conditions. Some of these minerals and
conditions are known (cite Eleemtns paers). However, Team0 can quickly and efficiently search for novel
mienrals and mineral/combinations, across vast expanses of the conditions that might be suitable for 
engineered approaches.

With our scientifically diverse skill set and extensive experience modeling geologic H2 generation, we bring a unique perspective to any collaborative research project. We specialize in providing high-throughput equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium geochemical modeles, enabling us to guide engineers in discovering optimal water-rock system for H2 generation. By analyzing and interpreting chemical models that span large ranges of the dependent variable space, we can identify the right conditions for hydrogen generation that should be tested further in laborary settints, and a process that would traditionally be time-consuming and expensive in the lab or the field.

Team 0 has the ability to test hypotheses and develop novel modeling and statistical packages with remarkable speed and efficiency. Our expertise in model and tool building allows us to quickly assess chemical and economic aspects. By rapidly ruling out possible generation methods, we can help engineering teams navigate the most promising avenues with precision and confidence.

... in progress ...

As we compete for the prestigious ARPA-E grant focused on Geologic Hydrogen, we firmly believe that we are the ideal fit to help address this critical challenge.







designing a research porject that will calucalate which naturally occurming mienrals generate H2 and under which conditions. 


Similar work, recently published by Team0 member Tucker Ely (link) explored how Ultramafic rocks
beneath the Earth's seafloor do just this, quantifying how smooth changes in rock compsotions and
reaction conditions generate a vast diversity of H2 concentrations.

Geologic H2 generated in this way is clean, avoiding the enviornemtnal side effects of carbon-based
fossil feuls.

We are intersted in which combinations of mienrals are ideal for H2 generation, and determineing
those that are most effective at the lowest cost, and where those minerals might naturally occur

Now,

1. ideal for H2 generation
2. most inexpensive to harness
3. where souch conditions might be naturally located, emplced, and built.
