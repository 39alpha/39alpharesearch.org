39A Team 0 is developing novel research approaches in anticipation of ARPA-E’s new hydrogen
generation initiative.

Talk about our previous H2 experience, with paper figures

Team-0’s Tucker Ely recently published original research describes how ultramafic rocks genera H2,
and explore vast amounts of the chemical variable space sampled by the earth naturally.

Talk about 3 novel approaches we are developing Now Team0 has decided to get creative, developing
novel approaches to H2 generation from geologic sources. Team0 is actively looking for collaborators
in their proposals to ARPA-E.
