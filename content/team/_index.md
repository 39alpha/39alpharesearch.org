Welcome! We are Team 0, 39 Alpha's inaugural research team. Born in the scorching heat of the
Sonoran desert in 2020[,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/09/01/phoenix-hottest-summer/)
we met while working between Everett Shock's [GEOPIG lab](https://search.asu.edu/profile/388445) (Group Exploring Organic Process In
Geochemistry) and Sara Walker’s [ELife
lab](http://emergence.asu.edu/) exploring astrobiology and related physics problems at Arizona
State University.

We share a passion for pure science, developing novel research ideas, building scientific software,
and arguing with each other. We also crave the pursue of challenging environmental projects
that lie outside traditional disciplinary silos. We believe humanity is at a unique point in
our collective history: Humans simultaneously have the power to destroy the environment that sustains
us while also harboring the intellect and compassion to investigate and comprehend our
impact on the Earth and its biosphere.

The diversity of our collective skill set&mdash;and our interest in exceptionally
interdisciplinary research&mdash;decreased our chances of getting hired somewhere together to do enviroentmal research.
So we decided to strike it out on our own, under [guiding principles](/) that we believe should be
common in science (but are not&mdash;yet).

Each of us at Team 0 maintains our public science careers in geochemistry, physics, and astrobiology.
Check out our Google Scholar profiles at the top of this page. However, as Team 0, we conduct research
on original projects that are necessary for the environment around us&mdash;whether or not they are easy
to fund, and without regard for discipline-specific orthodoxy. We research as a team, publish as a
team, and make our software and research public, as a team. This is how science should be conducted,
and we are living the change we want to see in science.

We are actively working on our [Carbonate State-Space](/projects/carbonate-state-space) project to
quantify the effect of $\ce{CO2}$-induced acidification on calcifying organisms in the Northern
Pacific Ocean. This project employs **Eleanor**, a unique Python package developed by
Team 0 in collaboration with [Brandy Toner](https://tonerlab.cfans.umn.edu/) and NASA’s [Exploring
Ocean Worlds](https://oceanworlds.whoi.edu/projects/exploring-ocean-worlds-exow/) initiative.
(Once we complete beta testing, **Eleanor** will be released publically on our [Github](https://github.com/39alpha) profile.)

We are also exploring new project ideas related to clean hydrogen generation from geologic sources.
Check out Tucker Ely’s recent [paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GC010658) on $\ce{H2}$-generation
in Ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems. Hydrogen has the potential to replace hydrocarbons as
societies dominant energy source. We are interested in discovering new geologic settings and
conditions that might yield large quantities of hydrogen naturally, and exploring which settings
might be easily harnessed by engineered solutions.
