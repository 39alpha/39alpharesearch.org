Welcome! We are Team 0, 39 Alpha's inaugural research team. Born in the [ridiculous heat](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/09/01/phoenix-hottest-summer/) of the Sonoran desert in 2020, we met while working between Everett Shock's [Group Exploring Organic Process In Geochemistry](https://search.asu.edu/profile/388445) and [Sara Walker’s ELife lab](http://emergence.asu.edu/) exploring novel astrobiology and related physics problems at Arizona State University.

Each of us had similar addictions to pure science, developing code for novel research ideas, and arguing with each other. Along the way we also discovered a craving for difficult environmental projects that ignore traditional disciplinary silos. We believe that humanity is at a unique point in our collective history. Humans simultaneously have the power to destroy the environment that sustain us (and we are) while also harboring the intellect and compassion to investigate and comprehend our impact on the Earth and it's biosphere.

We knew that the diversity of our collective skillset, and our interest in highly interdisciplinary research meant that our chances of getting hired together somewhere were minimal. So we decided to strike it out on our own, under [guiding principles]({{< ref "/" >}}) that should be common in science but are not.

Each of us at Team 0 maintains our public science careers in geochemistry, physics and astrobiology (check out of google scholar pages at the top of this page). However, as Team 0, we conduct research on original projects that are necessary for the environment around us, whether or not they are easy to fund, whether or not they would be easy to defend to a traditional program manager, and without regard for discipline-specific orthodoxy. We research as a team, publish as a team, and make our software and research public, as a team.  This is how science should be conducted, and we are living the change we want to see in science. 

Team 0 is actively working on their [Carbonate State-Space](/projects/carbonate-state-space) project, to quantify the effect of CO2-induced acidification on calcifying organisms in the Northern Pacific Ocean, where we are employing Eleanor, a novel code package originally developed by Team0 in collaboration with NASA’s [Exploring Ocean Worlds](https://oceanworlds.whoi.edu/projects/exploring-ocean-worlds-exow/) initiative. Eleanor will be publicly available soon, once she makes it out of the beta testing stage, so check back or pop into our [Github](https://github.com/39alpha) profile.  

We are also exploring new project ideas related to clean hydrogen generation from geologic sources. Check out Tucker Ely’s recent [paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022GC010658) on H<sub>2</sub>-generation in Ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems. Hydrogen has the potential to replace hydrocarbons as societies dominant energy source. We are interested in discovering new geologic settings and conditions that might yield large quantities of hydrogen naturally, and exploring which settings might be easily harnessed by engineered solutions.

If you are also driven by original environmental research, and want to see, please consider [donating](/donate). All donations to 39Alpha go to Team 0's active research projects.
