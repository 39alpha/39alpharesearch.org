Imagine sitting in bar in the early afternoon at a table full of your coworkers. The place is
relatively empty and you are speaking easily with everyone at the table, including that attractive
woman from accounting sitting a couple places down across the table, Mary. Eventually, happy hour
begins. The bar turns the music up and the crowds begin filing in. Thirty minutes later you are
talking loudly to the people sitting immediately next to you, Bob (also from accounting) and Jared
from customer support. You wanted to keep talking to the whole table, so as to include Mary from
accounting, but your environment changed. The noise has increased such that, even if you obnoxiously
shouted, she wouldn't make out the message in your words (and you’d look like an idiot). You really
wanted to get to know her, but there is no chance of that now. Only Todd will get that opportunity,
as he managed to snag the seat next to her when you all sat down.

Many whale species depend on long range vocal communication for locating conspecifics and especially
mates, including both mysticetes (baleen whales) and odontocetes (toothed whales).  The industrial
revolution, followed by increasing in shipping, recreational vehicles, and advances in modern
undersea warfare, has ushered in a new era of sound production in the seas across a range of
frequencies which include those used by whales

If regions of the sound spectrum used by whales which had been relatively quite during their
language evolution have become noisy, then the distance with which they can send and receive
information has likely gone down, as the signal to noise ratio has decreased. This may decrease the
distance to which young males can effectively signal in the search for females.

This project focuses on exploring the possibility that such noise pollution might cause regional
speciation via the segregating of previously overlapping populations, which would then be more
susceptible to the genetic instabilities associated with smaller reproductive groups.

1. Do whale populations have the numbers to support such speciation?
2. Can such noise pollution causes dialect schisms, even among populations that are otherwise
   overlapping at least part of the year? Can dialect schisms cause speciation?
3. How small do reproductive pools of different whale species need to become before the genetic
   instabilities result in likely extinction.
4. How small would resulting populations have to be in order to become susceptible to extinction via
   environmental change, bottleneck effects, overfishing, etc.
5. If such stocks are collapsed, what are the effects down the food web?
