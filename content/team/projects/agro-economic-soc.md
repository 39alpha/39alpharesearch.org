Every living thing consumes resources and every living thing can get sick. These two basic facts might seem like they have nothing do to with each other but in this project we'll explore how they combine to automatically push the global agricultural market into precarious balance between maximizing profits this year, and providing crops for the future. 

First, every living thing consumes resources. This is just a fancy way of saying, everyone's gotta eat. The global human population is not expected to level off before reaching 11 billion people. Feeding all of those people will require growing massive amount of produced. In order to get the most food out of the smallest area of land and least amount of water farmers and agricultural scientists selectively breed crops for desireable trait. For example, if a farmer notices that a particular type of wheat can grow with less water than other types, all things being equal, they're more likely to plant the one that requires less water the next year. Beyond that, farmers might talk to their neighbors, or read blogs about which variants of wheat are the easier to grow or produce the most yield. The net result of this is that globally, most farmers will converge on very few different types of wheat. When all the farmers in a specific area converge on the exact same variant of a crop, we call that a monoculture. Which brings us to the next basic fact. 

Every living thing can get sick. Everyone's experienced getting sick, you catch a cold, you get food poisioning, or you catch the flu. Many different diseases, including all the ones just listed, are caused by pathogens. Pathogens are viriuses or bacteria that survive by attacking healthy organisms. Not all pathogens effect all organisms the same way. That's why when you catch the flu, you worry about getting your partner, children or coworkers sick but you don't worry about your pets. Even within species genetic variations mean that individuals will react to the same pathogen differently. For example while you and your partner might catch the same flu, and one of you could get better in a couple days and the other could be sick for two weeks. This is where these two facts converge.

Monocultures are extremely susceptible to pathogens, because they have no diversity. This means that when a single organism in a monoculture gets really sick, all the organism around it are liable to get extremely sick, since they can all be expected to react to the pathogen in the same way. It's actually worse than that because pathogens, like all biological systems, evolve, and they evolve much faster than humans or crops. So when a pathogen is in a monoculture, it evolves to be more and more effective at attacking the exact organism. Imagine if you were given a puzzle to solve, the first time you had to solve it it might be pretty hard, but once you've figured it out, you can do it again in seconds. Thats what happens when pathogens evolve in monocultures. Once they evolve to attack the crop they can do it easily forever. This effect has led to famines in the past and was a key culprit in the Irish Potato Famine of 1740 that led to so many Irish immigrants coming to the US and Canada. 

So we have two different processes happening at once. On the one hand global optimization of food production (and farmer profit maximization) lead farmers to pick fewer and fewer unique crops. On the other hand, pathogens evolving to attack crops are only slowed down by genetic variation, and made more dangerous when fewer crops exist. Farmers obivously don't want to plant crops that will get sick but they want to plant the crops that will give them the biggest yield. This means they'll plant monocultures to get a pay-day today, even though they're risking a pathogen that could wipe out their whole crop. The fact that a single event (a pathogen emerging) can wipe out the entire crop, means the system is at a critical point. Critical points are situations where tiny changes (one plant gets sick) can lead to catastrophic outcomes (all the crops die). The fact that the economics of agriculture push the system to a critical point mean this is an example of self-organized criticallity. Self-organized just means that no one has to organize the system carefully to take it to a critical point, it does it automatically. 

In this project we'll model this type of self-organized criticallity to explore the consequences of these two forces working simutaneously and develop, model and analyze different policy proposals that might help develop a more robust and equitable argicultural system to meet the needs of a growing population.
