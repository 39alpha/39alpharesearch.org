$\ce{H2}$ can be generated when rocks react with water in the Earth's vast
subsurface, potentially providing a near-limitless source of carbon neutral—or
even carbon negative—fuel to energy markets. However, the relationship between
geologic conditions, stimulation methods, and $\ce{H2}$ production (both yield
and purity) is nebulous, and substantial research remains to be done. As a
result, geologic $\ce{H2}$ firms are flying blind, as it is impossible to
price/evaluate drill locations and stimulation protocols or to predict yield.
Optimal $\ce{H2}$-generating conditions remain elusive because computational
techniques, which might characterize $\ce{H2}$-producing systems, have remained
underdeveloped for decades.

39 Alpha Research is developing a revolutionary chemical mapping service under
an award from the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). We are
partnered with experimental teams from Lawrence Livermore National Labs, Koloma,
the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M, Eden GeoPower, and New England
Research, to reveal the chemical mechanisms that produce hydrogen from water in
natural systems.

39 Alpha's new technology will (1) assess the $\ce{H2}$ potential of any field
or laboratory water-rock-gas system, (2) reveal modification to fluid, rock,
or reaction conditions that maximize $\ce{H2}$ yield, and (3) discover and
circumvent kinetic barriers that depress $\ce{H2}$ production. These advances
will reduce the R&D cost of hydrogen exploration while furthering ARPA-E's goals
of increasing $\ce{H2}$ purity in stimulated systems and limiting concomitant
greenhouse gas emissions.
