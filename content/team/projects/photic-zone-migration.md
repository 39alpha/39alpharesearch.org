title: Photic Zone Migration
description: >-
    As sea levels fluctuate in response to decreases in the abundance of land-born ice, how does the
    photic zone migrate relative to sea floor topology? What are the implications for coral and
    their residents?

A lot of life in the oceans relies directly on sunlight as a energy source and the seafloor itself
to live on. This includes the majority if coral species.

Corals are important because they act as physical structures for other species to live among, like
the way tress in a forest act as homes for bugs, birds, reptiles, etc. Corals are also important
because to survive they breath in carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen.

Light from the sun can penetrate water, but only so deep. This means that corals living on the
seafloor can only live in relatively shallow water. As sea levels rise, much of the seafloor that is
currently lit up by sunlight during the day, may become too deep and therefore too dark, for coral
to survive. But at the same time, new land will become submerged, allowing for new coral habitats.
How does these two effects interact? Will rising sea levels create more or less space for coral
habitats?

We are interested in how the distribution of seafloor which coral can live on, will change as sea
levels rise.

As an analogy, imagine that you were to move the sprinklers watering a large garden, without regard
for the distribution of plants. Some areas of the garden would undoubtedly benefit from the new
arrangement, receiving water where there had been none before, and other areas would suffer, losing
access to the regular water to which they had been accustomed. This in turn, would have follow on
effects by affecting the species which live not on the water directly, but on the plants themselves.
