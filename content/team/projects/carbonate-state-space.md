The amount of $\ce{CO2}$ in the atmosphere is increasing as a result
of human activity and feedback from the Earth system. The oceans,
home to roughly $50\\%$ of Earthâ€™s primary biological production,
absorb a large percentage of this $\ce{CO2}$, driving numerous changes
in seawater chemistry. This project seeks to quantify the consequences of
rising atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ on chemical speciation in seawater, and to
demonstrate how these predictions can be used to identify chemical changes
that are likely to change selective pressure within marine ecosystems.

We will perform chemical speciation calculations of seawater under
increasing concentrations of atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ while accounting for
uncertainty and variation within the composition of modern seawater. The
resulting thermodynamic database will be unprecedented in its size and
scope, and accompanied by novel tools designed to

1. analyze and compare environmental measurements actively being generated
   from a host of globally distributed sampling stations;
2. quantify the distance between different seawater compositions in all
   thermodynamic and compositional dimensions;
3. estimate missing compositional data between disparate oceanic
   observations; and
4. make thermodynamic predictions about future seawater compositions
   and their effect on biogeochemical cycles.

To demonstrate how these thermodynamic predictions can be used to
understand the future of living systems in the ocean, we will use the
dataset to estimate the expected change in energetic efficiencies of
membrane ion pumps, which are ubiquitous in the biosphere.

Taken together, the results of this project will demonstrate a novel
approach to understanding the integration of geochemical and biological
systems by deploying high throughput thermodynamic calculations and
demonstrating how they can be used to anticipate biological changes. This
will power a new, data-driven paradigm for the prediction and study of
anthropogenic changes in the biosphere.
