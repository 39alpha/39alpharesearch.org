Carbon dioxide, also called "$\ce{CO2}$", is a gas produced by life and
by burning fossil fuels (gas, oil, and coal, to name a few). The amount
of $\ce{CO2}$ in the air around us is going up because we burn fossil
fuels. This change is invisible to us, but it represents a big shift
in the environment around us. For some living things, such as life in
the oceans, it completely changes the environment around them. Imagine
if suddenly your house had half as much food or water, or twice as
much. You would probably change the way you live. In one case you might
ration resources by taking fewer showers or eating smaller meals, but in
the other you might need to worry about food spoiling or flooding your
house. The goal of this project is to predict what sorts of changes are
expected for life in the oceans, as $\ce{CO2}$ rises in the world.

When the amount of $\ce{CO2}$ in the air increases, the amount of
$\ce{CO2}$ in the oceans will also increase. This is because the water
in the ocean is good at absorbing $\ce{CO2}$ from the air above it. In
both the air and in the water, when the amount of $\ce{CO2}$ increases,
many other things also change. One thing we already see is that seawater
is becoming acidic. Acids can wreak havoc on the tissues of living things
like coral (remember when Walter White and Jesse used acid to dissolve
something in Breaking Bad?). We don’t know yet what other aspects of the
ocean will change, but we have an idea. Returning to the food and water
example, if the amount of water in your house goes up, you should expect
the wood in the walls to start rotting and mold to start growing. What
else will happen in the ocean as the $\ce{CO2}$ levels go up?

In this project we’re going to focus on finding out what else
we expect to change in the ocean as the amount of $\ce{CO2}$
increases. Specifically, we want to find out what changes will happen
that will affect living things. All living things are made up of cells,
and those cells have to move charged particles, like protons, in and
out of themselves to stay alive. The “machinery” that cells use
to do this are called “ion pumps”. Ion pumps work sort of like air
conditioning in your house. In the same way your air conditioning adjusts
the temperature of your home to keep you comfortable, ion pumps adjust
the acidity in the cells to keep them happy. When the protons are pumped
out of the cell, the water around the cell becomes more acidic. What
if the water is already acidic? That will change how efficient the pump
is. The effect on the cell’s chances of survival will depend on what
it is using the pump for. So as a specific example we want to predict
how the $\ce{CO2}$ in the air will work its way into the oceans and then
influence the ion pumps living things depend on for survival.

The amount of $\ce{CO2}$ in the atmosphere is increasing as a result
of human activity and feedback from the Earth system. The oceans,
home to roughly $50\\%$ of Earth’s primary biological production,
absorb a large percentage of this $\ce{CO2}$, driving numerous changes
in seawater chemistry. This project seeks to quantify the consequences of
rising atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ on chemical speciation in seawater, and to
demonstrate how these predictions can be used to identify chemical changes
that are likely to change selective pressure within marine ecosystems.

We will perform chemical speciation calculations of seawater under
increasing concentrations of atmospheric $\ce{CO2}$ while accounting for
uncertainty and variation within the composition of modern seawater. The
resulting thermodynamic database will be unprecedented in its size and
scope, and accompanied by novel tools designed to

1. analyze and compare environmental measurements actively being generated
   from a host of globally distributed sampling stations;
2. quantify the distance between different seawater compositions in all
   thermodynamic and compositional dimensions;
3. estimate missing compositional data between disparate oceanic
   observations; and
4. make thermodynamic predictions about future seawater compositions
   and their effect on biogeochemical cycles.

To demonstrate how these thermodynamic predictions can be used to
understand the future of living systems in the ocean, we will use the
dataset to estimate the expected change in energetic efficiencies of
membrane ion pumps, which are ubiquitous in the biosphere.

Taken together, the results of this project will demonstrate a novel
approach to understanding the integration of geochemical and biological
systems by deploying high throughput thermodynamic calculations and
demonstrating how they can be used to anticipate biological changes. This
will power a new, data-driven paradigm for the prediction and study of
anthropogenic changes in the biosphere.
