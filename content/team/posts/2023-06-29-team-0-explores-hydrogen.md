39 Alpha's [Team 0](/team) has begun developing a novel research method to aid in the discovery of
mineral-based hydrogen generation techniques. This topic interests us greatly because we are more
than a group of geochemists, physicists, and software developers. We are passionate problem solvers
dedicated to making a meaningful impact on the world by conducting original scientific research that
positively impacts the environment—and by extension, humanity.

When water interacts with rocks and minerals in the environment, dihydrogen ($\ce{H2}$) can be
generated (but only sometimes and only under certain conditions). Some of these minerals and
conditions are known[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]. A recent publication on this topic was published by 39
Alpha team member Tucker Ely[^3], alongside co-authors
[James Leong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ma72boEAAAAJ&hl=en),
[Peter Conovas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Keg4MF4AAAAJ&hl=en),
and
[Everett Shock](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KDZS9jgAAAAJ&hl=en).
Ultramafic rocks (combinations of olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene) are known to generate
$\ce{H2}$. Tucker's latest work applies high-throughput modeling techniques to explore how smooth
variation in the composition of ultramafic rocks causes severe variation in $\ce{H2}$ generation.

Natural systems contain an incredible diversity of minerals, which are brought into contact with an
endless array of fluids across a range of temperatures, pressures, and compositions. [Team 0](/team)
is exploring an expansion of the techniques used in Ely et al., 2022[^3] to discover unrealized
combinations of minerals (or mineral combinations) and fluid conditions that will yield accessible
hydrogen. Where might such systems be found in nature? Are they accessible? Can we capture the
hydrogen or mine the minerals at a sufficiently low cost and environmental footprint to justify
their extraction?

With our scientifically diverse skill set and extensive experience modeling geologic $\ce{H2}$
generation, we bring a unique perspective to this problem. We specialize in providing
high-throughput equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium geochemical models, enabling us to guide
engineers in discovering optimal water-rock systems for $\ce{H2}$ generation. By analyzing and
interpreting chemical models that span large ranges of the dependent variable space, we can identify
ideal conditions for hydrogen generation that experimentalists should test further in laboratory
settings and field geologists should seek out. This process would traditionally be time-consuming
and vastly more expensive without large-scale modeling.

If you are interested in funding [Team 0](/team) to explore this idea (or others like it), please
