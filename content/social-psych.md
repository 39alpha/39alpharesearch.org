39Alpha maintains an in-house STIR team (aka “Social Psych”) which works to assess and improve
39alpha’s research method. The STIR team uses an interdisciplinary approach (called Socio-Technical
Integration Research) that was collaboratively developed with a team of engineers and that draws on
sociology, psychology, and political science. The approach has been tested in over 50 organizations
worldwide and will be used to assess and improve team performance.

The STIR team has access to all data generated by the science teams, and is responsible for:

1. Ensuring mission alignment
2. Enhancing creativity and productivity
3. Ensuring a healthy balance between mission alignment and creative freedom
4. Documenting and evolving the 39alpha research method
5. Publishing novel social-psych research results gleaned of this information in appropriate
   peer-reviewed journals
