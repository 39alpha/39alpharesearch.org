[Team 0](/team) member Dr. Tucker Ely is traveling to Washington, D.C., this week to represent 39
Alpha in discussions with [APRA-E](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/) about our ideas for potential sources
of sustainable, geochemical hydrogen generation as a clean fuel source. Dr. Ely's recent paper on
[dihydrogen generation in seawater](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GC010658) inspired this work, and we
can't wait to see where it takes us.

Check out our [post](/team/posts/2023-06-29-team-0-explores-hydrogen) for more details about our
hydrogen generation ideas.
