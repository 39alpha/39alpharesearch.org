39 Alpha's Team 0 is currently working on the [Carbonate State
Space](/projects/carbonate-state-space) project, which requires large-scale thermodynamic modeling
in geochemical systems. A key tool in this effort is the software package
[EQ3/6](https://doi.org/10.11578/dc.20210416.44), by Thomas Wolery at Lawrence Livermore National
Lab (LLNL)[^1]. EQ3/6 has historically been publicly hosted by LLNL, but recently it's disappeared!
But don't worry, you can find a public version with compilation instructions [on our
GitHub](https://github.com/39alpha/eq3_6). Check it out! We made some small modifications from the
original code, but those changes are documented.

39 Alpha will continue to keep these tools publicly available as part of our commitment to improve
open science practices.
