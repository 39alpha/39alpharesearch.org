[Team 0](/team) member Tucker Ely is traveling to Washington, D.C. this week to represent 39 Alpha
in a discussion with [APRA-E](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/) about our ideas for potential sources of
sustainable, geochemical hydrogen generation as a clean fuel source. This work was inspired by Dr.
Ely's recent paper on [dihydrogen generation in seawater](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GC010658), and
we can't wait to see where it takes us.

Have a look at our [post](/team/posts/2023-06-29-team-0-explores-hydrogen) about what we've been
thinking.
