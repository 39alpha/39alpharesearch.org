39Alpha's Team 0 is currently working the [Carbonate State Space](https://39alpharesearch.org/projects/carbonate-state-space/) project, which requires large-scale thermodynamic modelling in geochemical systems. A key tool in this effort is the software package [EQ3/6](https://doi.org/10.11578/dc.20210416.44), by Thomas Woolery at Lawernce Livermore National Lab (LLNL)[^1]. EQ3/6 has historically been publically hosted by LLNL, but recently it's dissapeared! But don't worry, you can find a public version with compliation instructions [on our github](https://github.com/39alpha/eq3_6). Check it out! We made some small modifications from the original code, but those changes are documented. 

39 Alpha will continue to keep these tools publically availible as part of our commitment to improve open science practices.
