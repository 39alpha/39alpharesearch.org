Our first team, Team-0 is working on a project that includes thermodynamic modelling of geochemical systems. A key tool in this effort is the software program(s) EQ3/6 produced by Thomas Woolery at Lawernce Livermore National Lab (LLNL). Until recently that code was provided pubically by LLNL, but recently it's dissapeared! But don't worry, you can find a public version with compliation instructions [on our github](https://github.com/39alpha/eq3_6), check it out! We made some small modifications from the original code, but those changes are documented. 

39 Alpha will continue to keep these tools publically availible as part of our commitment to improve open science practices.
