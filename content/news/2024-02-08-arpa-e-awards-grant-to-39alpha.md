39 Alpha Research is pleased to announce that we have been awarded a grant by the Department of Energy’s [Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/) (APRA-E) program to explore the [stimulated production of geologic hydrogen](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-media/press-releases/us-department-energy-announces-20-million-16-projects-spearheading).

Geologic hydrogen is hydrogen gas ($\ce{H2}$) that is produced through reactions between water and rock in Earth's subsurface. $\ce{H2}$ is a clean energy source that produces no carbon when burned or used in a fuel cell, and so represents a promising target for the United States' decarbonization efforts.

39 Alpha's [Team 0](/team) will leverage it's expertise in high-throughput computation and geochemistry provide large-scale, high-resolution modeling support to other ARPA-E funded teams in an effort to maximize the production of $\ce{H2}$ through subsurface water-rock interactions.

Learn more about 39 Alpha’s work on Geologic $\ce{H2}$ production [here](/team/posts/2023-06-29-team-0-explores-hydrogen), and stay tuned for more exciting news!
