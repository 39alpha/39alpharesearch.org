# Non-Governmental Agencies

## Discussion

[Grantmaker Review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11XoB_CxMrMfn6h6T1pOWxvzMhaTqpKQpmc_wDt4IR3A/edit?usp=sharing)

- Reviewed *Sloan Foundation*, *Dorrance Family Foundation* and *Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation*
	- **Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation**
		- Requirements:
			- 2 years of financial audit statements
			- Organization-wide budget that includes both expenses and revenue projections
			- Audit management letters
			- Year-to-date financials
			- Indirect costs vs. direct cost limitations
			- No documentation on requirements for founding documents/policies
		- Possible Pitches:
			- The "39 Alpha Method" in its own right. This would require:
				- A solid outreach plan
				- Evidence that it works
				- The right foundation
			- The Monocrop Project
			- Possibly leverage scientific software
		- Proposals are invitation only
			- 100 word email required as "Letter of Intent"
		- No money for religious organizations
	- **Sloan Foundation**
		- 20% indirects
		- Energy & Environment — 39 Alpha might not fit
		- Letter of Enquiry — 1 or 2 pages
		- Smaller grants than Morre Foundation $50K - $100K
		- No stated organizational requirements (policies/bylaws)
	- **Dorrance Family Foundation**
		- No funding in 2019 (COVID)
		- Sort of a "Mom and Pop" operation
		- Arizona, California and Hawaii only
		- Letter of inqury required
		- No stated organizational requirements (policies/bylaws)

# Governmental Agencies

## Discussion

[Funding Requirements of Governmental Agencies](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_S8WsQXU1PSYbQp5Ik2P26nMzIUrPXBdmFkASpjXlfU/edit?usp=sharing)

- **National Science Foundation**
	- Allows non-profits to submit proposals
	- Does not require a Conflicts of Interest policy for organizations fewer than 50 people
	- Does require:
		- Responsibility and Ethical Conduct of Research (RECR) Policy
		- Financial Management Systems Policy
		- Property Management Standards Policy
		- Procurement Standards Policy
	- Most/All proposals also require a Data Management plan
	- Making some or all of these policies standard across the organization might be worth
	  doing to minimize effort
	- Data Management is our "property", so there may only be a weak distinction between the DM
	  and the PMS policy. Perhaps thy could be the same Policy?

# Review Analogous Non-Profit Policies

## Discussion

- **Santa Fe Institute**
	- No bylaws on website
	- Financial statements on website
	- One-page ethics statement on website
- **NumFocus**
	- Found bylaws — nothing terribly relevant to science
- **Perimeter Institute**
	- Nothing found

# Website Revisions

## Discussion

- The transition from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is complete
- The site is now live on IPFS: https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipns/39alpharesearch.org
- Domain Name Resolution is broken:
	- Currently experiencing 404 erros
	- When it works, https://39alpharesearch.org resolves to the above gateway
- Either [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) or [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) might be
  reasonable options for donation processing and record management.
