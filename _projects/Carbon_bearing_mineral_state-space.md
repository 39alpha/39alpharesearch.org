Lets say that you wanted to bake a chocolate cake, and you want to attempt this with the ingredients already in your kitchen. You sort through your pantry, pulling out all the ingredients that you’ll need. Alas, you find that you have almost everything, except, you are missing three eggs. You cannot bake the cake!

The kitchen in this case is your environment, and it cannot support the baking (formation) of a chocolate cake. You can think of this kitchen as having a *distance* from the chocolate cake, and that distance is measured in eggs. IE, if you added three eggs to the kitchen it would support the formation of the chocolate cake. 


This concept of a system (the kitchen in this case), and a distance of the system from some desired outcome (the baking of the cake), is central to many problems in science. Distances are not simply measured in feet, or miles, but can be most anything. In this case, eggs!


In this way, the project described to the right is measuring the distance of different water-based environments (lakes, streams, ship bilges, whatever it may be) from their inclination to precipitate (form) minerals which contain carbon. Mineral precipitation, such as when calcium builds up on your shower head, is a common feature of water-based systems. In the case of carbon, precipitation of minerals that contain carbon can offer a way to remove it from the atmosphere, and hence our interest here.

The distance measure that is typically used in chemistry is in terms of energy. However we cannot add pure energy as a component in a system in the same way that you can add eggs to you kitchen. We can however change other aspects of a system, which affect the ‘energetic state’ of the system. 

For example, at times we can change the temperature and pressure of a fluid, but for the most part we can add components to a system. These are like the ingredients in the cake. Therefore, adding an egg to your kitchen to bring it closer to making a cake, is like adding dissolved iron to a pond, to bring it closer to precipitating a mineral called siderite.


This is where the analogy gets weird. The kitchens and their ingredients have a static (unchanging) relationship to the cake. If I add one egg to my kitchen, I am no longer three eggs short of the cake, but just two. Imagine however, that when you add one egg, you are no longer short just two eggs, but are now also half a cup of flour short. This is how chemical systems work in the environment. They are not static landscapes, but they are ‘dynamic’ landscapes. Everything affects everything else when it comes to the stability of a mineral. Need more calcium in the fluid to precipitate a mineral? Well adding more calcium can change a very important feature called the pH, which affects the stability of the mineral you are interested in precipitating.

This project is focused on finding ALL compositional deviations that might be experienced by a large range of water-based systems, including temperature and pressure, to motivate the precipitation of carbon-bearing minerals in those systems with the complication that, we have to take into account this dynamic behavior when we consider how a system will have to change to support the precipitation of a given mineral.


Another important concept in science that might seem strange to non-scientists is that we can study things in theory without actually realizing their existence in the physical world. IE, we can study what is possible and imagine worlds where those possibilities are realized, whether they are or not.

In this case, we can learn something from common features of all likely environments, and their relationship to each of our minerals of interest. This would be like imagining all possible kitchens and their collective relationship to the chocolate cake. 

Sitting in your kitchen, you imagine that, of all the kitchens that are in your city (thats a lot of kitchens) that all will contain different quantities of a unique set of ingredients. Therefore, they will all have a unique relationship to the chocolate cake. We would say that such a dataset had important information in its structure. Maybe the majority of kitchens that fall short of the cake are missing coca powder as it is generally a rarer ingredient. Maybe you find that, if flour is missing, then milk is over abundant, and so on. 

Important information exists in the collective relationships between the environments (kitchens), their distances from the cake, and the ways in which they would have to be altered to bring the kitchen-cake distance to zero.

Such a dataset, viewed in its entirety, could point you in the right direction if you are interested in adding the fewest possible ingredients to the fewest number of kitchens to get the largest number of chocolate cakes.

THIS is what we plan to do with water-based environments and carbon-bearing minerals.
Of all the water-based systems that are likely to exist near the surface of the Earth (where carbon precipitation may be beneficial), there exists a unique set of relationships to the precipitation of carbon-bearing minerals, and a unique combination of alterations that would have to take place to bring the environment-mineral distance to zero. Which environments would have to be altered the least to affect the largest change in carbon?


<hr />

We wish to map the variable-space of CO2 bearing mineral phases (calcite, aragonite, siderite, etc.) 
as it relates to variation in all major element abundances, temperature, pressure, pH, and fO2 of aqueous 
environments common to the Earth’s surface.

Conventional environmental chemistry approaches in aqueous environments consider the precipitation of 
mineral phases if their stability fields are intersected by a given fluid system being modeled as it is 
driven to change in T, P, fO2 etc. via measures such as affinity or Gibbs free energy. We wish to take 
a reverse approach, beginning instead with an aqueous system that clearly falls within the stability 
field of a given carbon bearing mineral, before changing every thermodynamic aspect that is contained 
within, moving about this state-space in small steps, defining the full n-dimensional stability field of the given mineral. 


Once this state-space has been filled (and it will be computationally dense as it is of a very high dimension, 
with each element and thermodynamic state variable providing a dimension), locales on Earth (lakes, rivers, 
streams, derived fluids in industry, mining, manufacturing etc.) that overlap with this space or fall near 
to it can be pondered, effectively painting these environments back onto the carbon-bearing minerals. 

There is a lot to be be learned from the shape of this state space and the distance and direction to any 
given environmental sample, as environments which are close to but not overlapping with it might be easily 
altered such that they precipitate a given carbon phase. In this way a list of previously unrealized carbon 
sinks might be discovered.
