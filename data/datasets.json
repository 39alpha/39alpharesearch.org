We have emphasized, time and again, that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, prohibts the federal courts of appeals from relying on their own precendent to conclude that a particular constitutional principle is \"clearly established.\" See, e.g. Marshal v. Rodgers, 569 U.S. _, _ (2013) (per curiam) (slip op. at 6). Because the Ninth Circuit failed to comply with this rule, we reverse its decision granting habeas relief to respondent Marvin Smith.",
