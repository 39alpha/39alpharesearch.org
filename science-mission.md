"To Explore and Quantify the Human Effect on Earth"
</div>

It is the ultimate goal of 39Alpha teams to explore and quantify human interaction with our
biogeochemical environment. Specifically, we are focused on interactions which may not reside in
steady state, so that we might identify deleterious components of our effects, and postulate
associated solutions.

The 39Alpha teams are free to engage in research which supports this ultimate goal in any way they
see fit. The developing projects described below are examples of the type of projects which will be
engaged upon to support the overall mission.
